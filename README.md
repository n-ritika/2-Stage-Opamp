# 2-Stage-Opamp
Design and analysis of a 2-stage op-amp using Miller compensation technique and Nulling resistor compensation technique. 
 A two-stage operational amplifier consists of a differential amplifier at the. input stage, while the second stage is a high gain stage biased by the output of the differential amplifier.The first stage is a differential pair with a current mirror load. The second stage is a common source amplifier. Use a simple current source with a diode-connected PMOS load as the bias circuit.
